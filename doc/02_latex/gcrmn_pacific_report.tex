\subsubsection{Geographic information's}

For the individual territory assessments, we provided different values related to the geography, the population or the economy of the territories. These values were obtained using the following data sources and methodologies.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Maritime area.
	\item Land area.
	\item Reef area.
	\item Human population (in 2020). The values of human population living on each of the territories were estimated using the Gridded Population of the World v4.0 dataset (REF). This dataset consists of a grid of x ° pixel. The values of pixel within an economic exclusive zone were summed up using Google Earth Engine (REF).
	\item Mean elevation
