	\section*{The GCRMN: context and objectives}
	
	Coral reefs of the Anthropocene are affected by a wide range of direct and indirect anthropogenic stressors (Wilkinson, 1999). The cummulated impacts of these stressors have affected the state and functionning of coral reefs (REF). For example, multiple studies have shown a decrease in hard coral cover (REF), fish biomass (REF), and accretion (REF) in numerous coral reefs of the world, even on those which have long been considered too remote from human activities to be affected by them (REF).
	
	To reverse the global decline of coral reefs, or at least to stop it, several national and international policies have been undertaken. For example, the Aichi target number 10 from the Convention on Biological Diversity aimed to minimize the anthropogeneic pressures affecting coral reefs to maintain their integrity and functionning (UNEP/CBD/COP/10/27, 2011). The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework reaffirmed the objectives of the Aichi targets for the 2020-2030 decade (CBD/COP/DEC/15/4, 2022). However, to measure target progress of these initiatives, it is crucial to have quantitative syntheses at large spatial scales (Orr et al., 2022).
	
	The Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN) aims to produce regular syntheses about status and trends of coral reefs, to inform policy makers, managers, and scientists. Created in 1995 as an operational network of the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI), the GCRMN operates through 10 regional nodes (REF ).  These nodes .

Ouano Marine Protected Area (3,499 ha) was created in 1989 but the MPA is implemented and enforced since 2007. The MPA extends from the coastline to the outer slope. The objective is the conservation of the lagoon seascape (mangrove, soft-bottoms, coral reefs) in the context of sustainable development. Ouano MPA is also included in the Lagoons of New Caledonia: Reef Diversity and Associated Ecosystems, a UNESCO world heritage site since 2008. The MPAS effects were assessed for coral reef fish, macroinvertebrates and coral habitat, using a Before-After Control-Impact Paired Series (BACIPS) design. The sampling network includes two unprotected areas, located North and South of the MPA. Three surveys were conducted before enforcement (2004-2006), then 7 surveys after (2007-2020), all at the same season. Each survey consisted of 30 stations sampled on coral reefs (fringing reef, lagoon reef and inner barrier reef). Eighteen are located within the MPA and 12 outside on unprotected reefs. At each station, the reef flat, the reef crest and the reef slope were sampled.

The first significant MPAs effects were detected in 2009, three years after enforcement. Then they increased until 2014, and they were still efficient during the last survey in 2020 despite a lowering for several indicators. The commercial fish species increased in the MPA until 2014 while it remained stable outside (Figure 1). The MPA effects are even more significant for the biomass of commercial species, with a constant increase since enforcement, compared to the stability recorded outside the MPA (Figure 1). The main families benefiting from protection are the groupers and the acanthurids. The coral trout illustrates these positive effects. The species was observed only once in the unprotected zone and only twice in the MPA before enforcement. Now, the species is censused In the MPAs every survey since enforcement, with maximum densities and biomasses since 2014. Similar patterns are described for the humphead wrasse and the bluespine unicornfish. These three fish species are among the most targeted coral reef fish in the country. Macroinvertebrates also benefited from MPA effects, such as the commercial top shell, the giant clams and the lobsters. No MPA effect was detected for the coral habitat as the anthropogenic pressure was similar inside and outside the MPA.

Points represent the mean between stations within (\textit{n} = 18) and outside (\textit{n} = 12) the MPA, and error bars represent the mean $\pm$ standard error. The lines between the points are only intended to show the temporal trends and do not rely on data.}

However, the level of these positive effects is directly related to the enforcement strategy. A change of the management of the MPA occurred in 2014. Before, the ranger?s office in charge of the MPA enforcement was located on top of a hill with a direct view on all the MPA. Similarly, any person in the MPA can see the office. In 2014, the office was moved to the village of La Foa. The presence of the ranges on the water increased but they had no view of the MPA from their office anymore. At the same time, we observed a stabilization or a decrease of the MPA effects on several indicators between 2014 and 2020, such as illustrated by the commercial fish species richness (Figure 1). We hypotheses that the presence of the ranger's office in view of the MPA had a significant dissuasive impact on potential poachers. This highlights the importance of the perception of control strategy by the users of the area.
