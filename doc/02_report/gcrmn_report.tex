\THEMEB{Cyclones}

Between 1980 and 2022, a total of 14 tropical storms passed within 100 km from a coral reef of French Polynesia, and of these 10 were characterized by sustained wind speed greater than 100 km.h-1. Due to its proximity to the equator, the Marquesas archipelago was less affected by cyclones than the rest of the territory. The cyclone with the highest sustained wind speed over the studied period was the cyclone Veena, in 1983, which passed from 14 km from a coral reef with sustained wind speed of 185 km.h-1.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{02_part-2/fig-5/french-polynesia}
	\caption[Maximum sustained wind speed of cyclones within 100 km of a coral reef between 1980 and 2023 over the territory of French Polynesia.]{Maximum sustained wind speed of cyclones within 100 km of a coral reef between 1980 and 2023 over the territory of French Polynesia. Colors correspond to the cyclone category on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The values of sustained wind speed are extracted from the nearest tropical storms position from a coral reef. For this reason, some sustained wind speed values are below the lower threshold of category 1 Saffir-Simpson scale (i.e. 119 km/h).}
	\label{chapter1:fig2}
\end{figure}

The impacts of some of these cyclones on coral reefs have been described in the scientific literature. Notably the impacts of cyclones occurring between 1982 and 1983 are detailed in (Harmelin-vivien \& Laboute, 1986). More recently, the impact of cyclones Wasa that occurred in 1991 and Oli that occurred in 2010 on hard coral cover has been described by (Lamy et al., 2016).
